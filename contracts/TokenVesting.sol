 * @title TokenVesting
 * @dev This contract handles the vesting of an ERC20 token for multiple beneficiaries. Custody of the token
 * should be given to this contract, which will release the token to a beneficiary following a given vesting schedule.
 * The vesting schedule is customizable through the {vestedAmount} function.
 *
 * The token transferred to this contract will follow the vesting schedule as if it was locked from the beginning.
 * The contract takes into account a cliff period after which the actual claiming of any unlocked tokens should begin.
 * Some percentage of the total tokens allocated for distribution to a beneficiary are released initially without waiting any time.
